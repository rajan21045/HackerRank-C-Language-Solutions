Objective

The fundamental data types in c are int, float and char. Today, we're discussing int and float data types.

The printf() function prints the given statement to the console. The syntax is printf("format string",argument_list);. In the function, if we are using an integer, character, string or float as argument, then in the format string we have to write %d (integer), %c (character), %s (string), %f (float) respectively.

The scanf() function reads the input data from the console. The syntax is scanf("format string",argument_list);. For ex: The scanf("%d",&number) statement reads integer number from the console and stores the given value in variable number.

To input two integers separated by a space on a single line, the command is scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), where n and m are the two integers.

Task

Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:

1. Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.
2. Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your 4 variables.
3. Use the + and - operator to perform the following operations:
        (.) Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
        (.) Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers.
The second line contains two floating point numbers.

Output Format

Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space on the first line, and the sum and difference of both float (scaled 1 to  decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.

Sample Input
10 4
4.0 2.0

Sample Output
14 6
6.0 2.0

When we sum the integers 10 and 4, we get the 14 integer . When we subtract the second number 4 from the first number 10, we get 6 as their difference.

When we sum the floating-point numbers 4.0 and 2.0, we get 6.0. When we subtract the second number 2.0 from the first number 4.0, we get 2.0 as their difference.
